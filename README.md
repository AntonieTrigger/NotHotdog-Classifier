# NotHotdog-Classifier
What would you say if I told you there is a app on the market that tell you if you have a hotdog or not a hotdog. It is very good and I do not want to work on it any more. You can hire someone else.


Here is a demonstration of the final version of the product that we are going to be making

# Step 1: Collecting data
The very first step in making a classifier is to collect data. Thus we need to find images of hotdogs and not-hotdogs. The best way do this is if you a professor at Stanford and you give each of your student an assignment to collect images of food for you, but be warned that they might try and steal your Idea.

So if you're not a professor at Stanford you will need to collect the data yourself :(   Since Im not a processor at Stanford I had to collect the images myself. To do this I just used [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) to search for my images, since ImageNet is like a database for images. To find the hotdog images I searched for “hotdog”, “chili dog” and “frankfurter” this give me about 1857 images.  For the not-hotdog images I searched for “food”, “furniture”, “people” and “pets” this give about 4024 not-hotdog images.

Now theses are the images that I want to download I just need to click on the tab download tab click on link
![ImageNet1]

then copy the url to get the urls for all of the images
![ImageNet2]


# Step 2: Cleaning the data

# Step N: Profit
Now that we are done we can sell it to Periscope and become very rich
