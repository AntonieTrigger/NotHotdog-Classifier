# NotHotdog-Classifier
What would you say if I told you there is a app on the market that tell you if you have a hotdog or not a hotdog. It is very good and I do not want to work on it any more. You can hire someone else.


Here is a demonstration of the final version of the product that we are going to be making

# Step 1: Collecting data
The very first step in making a classifier is to collect data. Thus we need to find images of hotdogs and not-hotdogs. The best way do this is if you a professor at Stanford and you give each of your student an assignment to collect images of food for you, but be warned that they might try and steal your Idea.

So if you're not a professor at Stanford you will need to collect the data yourself :( 

For this I just used [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) since it is like a database of images.


Now that we are done we can sell it to Periscope and become very rich
